    <h1>🎊 Hey, hey - March 3rd is my birthday!</h1>
    <p>This year, instead of coming to a party (😷) or giving gifts, can you please favor me by giving the good cause I
        have
        listed below 🙏?</p>
    <p>I laid out 4 ways to participate, and two of them cost nothing. Anything is appreciated 💙</p>
    <h2>📖 First some backstory:</h2>
    <p>In 2020 my wife and I, along with some friends, studied the books in the Bible about the Jewish exiles. We were
        inspired by these brave dreamers who had hope beyond hope, and trusted God&rsquo;s plan for their life.</p>
    <p>I was surprised by how often the fate of the exiles was due to the generosity and faith and bravery of other
        people. Esther lobbied the king even though it was illegal for her to do so, and it saved her people, the Jews.
        Daniel served faithfully before kings and one of them allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>That pattern of advocacy, even if it meant personal danger, inspired Alex and I to recently take our own big risk
        in
        support of what we believe in.</p>
    <h2>🎯 Around the same time, an opportunity opened up </h2>
    <p>Our children&rsquo;s school participated in a supply drive for an organization that
        supports refugee families as they settle into Greensboro. Our city has a rich history of welcoming new North
        Carolinians. The Washington Post even dubbed Greensboro as &ldquo;<a
            href="https://greensboro.com/news/discover/little-ellis-island/article_dbf65c60-1984-5fc6-8036-980090f63324.html">a
            little Ellis Island</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Alex and I felt inspired to participate in helping these &ldquo;modern day exiles&rdquo; and we would like you to
        join us! Please choose one or more of the options below.</p>

    <h2>1. 💰 Monetary Donations (matched up to $1,000 total)</h2>

    <p>The first way you can help is by donating to the UNC Greensboro&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a
            href="https://cnnc.uncg.edu/">Center for New North
            Carolinians</a>a>&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://cnnc.uncg.edu/give/">direct donation link</a>a>.
    </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s tax deductible of course. And all donations made, from now to March 9th, will be matched, up to a
        total of $1k. After you donate, just shoot me an email with the amount - hashimwarren@gmail.com.</p>
    <p>From their website:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The CNNC promotes access and integration for immigrants and refugees in North Carolina by bridging
        newcomer populations with existing communities through direct service provision, research, and training.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve met some of their staff, and we&rsquo;ve donated to them before. They are excellent. Take a look at
        their programs and services.</p>

    <h2>2. 👶 Donate Diapers&nbsp;</h2>

    <p>You can also donate diapers of all sizes to CNNC. My family will collect them and drop them off.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to diapers, you can also donate:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>🧹 cleaning supplies&nbsp; </li>
        <li>🥫 dry goods </li>
        <li>💳 grocery gift cards </li>
        <li>🎨 children's art kits </li>
    </ol>

    If you donate any of the above, please bring it in a box or bag.

    <h3>Here are the details for the drop off</h3>
    <blockquote>

        <p> <strong> Date:</strong> March 6th, 2021</p>
        <p> <strong> Time:</strong> 12PM - 1PM</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We&rsquo;re following all covid-19 safety rules - 6 feet apart, with masks, and outside. Come say
        &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to us, and donate!</p>

    <h2> 3. 🙏 Pray for the Families and Workers</h2>

    <p>Please join Alex and I in putting refugee families and the workers who serve them on your prayer lists.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please ask for the families to feel supported as they adjust to a new land, and for their needs to be taken care
        of. Also please ask God to bless the workers and give them strength, wisdom, and love.&nbsp;</p>
